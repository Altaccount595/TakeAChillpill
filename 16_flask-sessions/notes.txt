Our goal is to make a dictionary with all the usernames made and if they are logged in atm
Keys would be usernames, values would be booleans
There shouldn't be more than one true value at a time, because value is set to false when user logs out
For right now when app.py is terminated the dictionary would be cleared.
Unclear where to store the dictionary for right now, store it as a variable in app.py, or write out to a seperate file like a cookie. 
C is for cookie and cookie is for me
